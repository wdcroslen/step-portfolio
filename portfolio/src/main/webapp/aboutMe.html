      <p>Welcome adventurous individuals who dare to learn more about yours truly! In this short paragraph I will take you on a journey through my life so be prepared!</p>
      <p>Well first things first is I love memes! I always enjoy a little bit of a laugh from captions and images and what better way than a good old meme.</p>

      <p> I really enjoy learning in school and have attended a few conferences and hackathons to further expand my computer science knowledge!</p>
      <p>Some of my hobbies include camping and playing piano and working out! All of these activities help me relax and I always feel productive doing them! </p>
      <p> I enjoy traveling a lot and one day hope to eventually venture to every continent in the world! My most recent trip with some friends was when I went to Hawaii during spring break and I had a blast!</p>
